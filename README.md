# INFS7901-database

INFS7901 database principles: involve data modelling, representation, query and maintenance of data integrity. Hands-on experiences will be provided for students to create a basic database application system. In order to provide effective and efficient data management, we will study algorithms for effective access to structured data with different data processing requirements.
